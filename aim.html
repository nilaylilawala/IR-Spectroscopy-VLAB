<div class="container">
    <a id="area1" class="area11">The bands are attributed to single bonds to hydrogen e.g. C-H,O-H and N-H. The
        bands of O-H and N-H are broad due to hydrogen bonds.</a>
    <a id="area2" class="area22">The bands are attributed to triple bonds e.g. C=C, C=N and X=Y=Z</a>
    <a id="area3" class="area33">The bands are attributed to double bonds e.g. C=C, C=O and C=N The bonds of an
        aromatic ring appear at lower frequencies, due to the increased single bond character of the conjugated
        system.</a>
    <a id="area4" class="area44">
        This is the fingerprint region. This region is unique for every compound. It includes stretching,
        scissoring, bending and rotating vibrations. It is very hard to interpret this data.</a>
